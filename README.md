# Leptos Auth

## A working reusable Rust authentication stack

### Features:
- A full stack Rust application built with Leptos - provides a convenient WASM based web UI
- Uses Leptos's Actix Web integration to separate server & client side logic
- Secure password hashing with Argon2
- Leverages Actix Redis-based Session store to maintain user sessions
- Uses Diesel to persist data in Postgres database as well as handle database initialization and migration

Still a work in progress!
